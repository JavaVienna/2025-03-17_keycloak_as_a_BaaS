# Java Vienna Keycloak SPA Example

This uses a modified version of the @tanstack/react-router + oidc-spa + Vite + Keycloak example found here: https://github.com/keycloakify/oidc-spa/tree/main/examples/tanstack-router

# How to run?

Just run `mvn package` once. After that you can run `yarn dev`.

If you run `mvn deploy` a docker-container is build and pushed to your local docker registry.
